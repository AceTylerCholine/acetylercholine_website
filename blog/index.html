        Why are You Even Talking to Me?
        <i class="fa fa-chevron-down fa-xs blog-icon"></i>
    </h2>
    <div id="post1" class="blog-post-content">
      <p class="indent">I've wanted to write a blog for years and have always talked myself out of it. The main reason being, 'Who the f--- do you think you are? What could you possibly have to say that anyone else wants to read?'. Yet here I am, writing a blog, so what is my response to those questions? Honestly, I don't have a great response. I'm a cis-het white man who's in the first year of a PhD; my experiences aren't that unique, people that look like me are the majority in science, and I'm not even far enough in my career to offer sage advice. I want to say 'But I'm not like the others, I grew up poor', which is only partly true, but hear me out, and I'll come back around to try to answer this question.</p>
      <p class="indent">Since I first applied to college, I've felt like I don't belong there, which is also partly true. I never really cared about grades; my main concern was passing because I didn't want to fail a grade or retake a class, so as you can assume, my grades were awful. After I graduated high school, I knew I wanted to go to college, but for reasons of laziness and apathy I waited months before I applied to the university in the town I grew up in. I'm lucky that I didn't live near a university with higher admission standards because for some reason they accepted me last minute even with my abysmal grades and 75th percentile ACT scores.</p>
      <p class="indent">In classic millennial academic fashion, I was in some advanced courses in middle and high school, and had always found school to be easy. 'Why would I do homework? That's a waste of time, I want to climb trees and play video games.' Eventually my advanced classes actually became challenging, how exciting! I took pre-calculus and started to learn about cosines and tangents and my mind was blown; I actually struggled to follow along. However, was my response to take advantage of this? No. I had a blast following along in class, and still had no interest in homework, but I managed to do enough homework to study just the right amount to barely pass the class.</p>
      <p class="indent">Maybe college will be different? No! It's way too early in this story for that 'great ordeal' or 'revelation' stage. Okay, I hate to keep doing this to you, but to really get at why I question my voice and the point of all this, let's rewind again. Let's frame my childhood, who is this kid, or at least, what's the story he's telling himself now about who he was as a kid?</p>
      <p class="indent">The story in my head is that both of my parents were drug addicts, and when my older brother was ~6 and I was ~3, my parents divorced and both got clean. I ended up living with my dad, and then he had a stroke and we grew up on welfare. There have been people who never experienced anything like that, and are bewildered by this background, then there are others who, like me, just see it as part of normal life. I want to be clear, I want absolutely zero pity about this story, not in a pitiful person not wanting to be pitied way, but in a 'you don't understand, it wasn't actually pitiful' way. I grew up living with my dad and older brother, and visiting my mom every other weekend. When I tell you my life was filled with love, you have no idea. You know what having an older brother felt like to me? Like a hyper-intelligent fairy god parent that occasionally (often) beats you up while wrestling over a toy or some argument or you being an annoying little brother. When you see someone 4 days a month, they can only have so much of an impact on you, but my mom definitely had a positive impact on me. While both my parents consistently told us that they love us no matter what and that we could be anything we wanted to, my father spent most of his days in a recliner watching TV, while when I was with my mom we would eat home cooked meals and do things as a family. And let me tell you, to have 3 people who love you and make you feel safe, even if it would've been in a warzone, that's still better than most people had it.</p>
      <p class="indent">Granted, this is the version of my childhood that I'm remembering as a 33-year-old. I could be wrong about a lot of this, but this is the story that I have (without asking for verification from anyone else that was around at that time). Without going into even further details, that was my life: being carefree. So, why would grades matter? Nothing bad ever happens? What's the worst that could happen?</p>
      <p class="indent">So back to college, things aren't too much different at first. I like all my classes for the most part, I attend most/all of my lectures, I don't study, and I do minimal homework. Then my father has another stroke during my first semester. He's in a coma for months, and has been in a nursing home ever since. He can't communicate verbally, and his cognition is confusing so communicating in other ways is limited. It was too late in the semester to drop classes without a refund, and I was under the impression that my financial aid didn't allow me to drop classes without a refund. Then I make the mistake of enrolling the next semester while lying to myself that everything was handled with my father and I can go back to class like nothing is wrong. Then I get put on academic probation and can't use financial aid for 1 year. Eventually I obtain an associate, bachelor, and master's degree, making so many more mistakes along the way (that's a story for another time), but there I am again, applying to colleges with unimpressive grades and again somehow making it into a PhD program.</p>
      <p class="indent">My challenges can't compare to anyone else's. I told you earlier about how lucky I was to grow up feeling safe and loved; I also told you about my crappy grades simply being a product of laziness and apathy, but I made it, didn't I? There are countless people I've met who have accomplished and overcome so much that I can't even comprehend the emotional, mental, and physical energy it took. Some people are born with a silver spoon and some people work their lives to obtain one, but if we're discussing how to obtain a silver spoon, both people should have a seat at the table. I unfortunately have a tendency to be classist and elitist. I feel jealousy towards the haves while I angrily place myself in the have-nots. It's not fair that some people got into a good school because someone taught them the importance of good grades, it's not fair that some people got prestigious opportunities because they knew where to look while I did not, but also it's not fair that I had healthcare as a child because my family was poor enough for government benefits while my low-income friends and peers had to choose between food and a doctor. It's not fair that I had a carefree childhood while SO. MANY. other children never knew what safety felt like.</p>
      <p class="indent">So, back to why am I even talking to you? Why do I feel like I have something to say? I don't think I'm special, but I do think that transparency can improve all of our lives. I'd like to think that I deserve everything I've gotten, but in reality, it feels like I just typically come across as a genuine and likable guy a lot, and maybe other people deserved the chances I received more. Maybe the people who feel like they missed the opportunities that I received will be able to compare themselves to me in a more transparent way, rather than blame themselves. Maybe someone reading this was literally my competition in some opportunity I received, and they can decide more confidently that they deserved it more, or maybe they'll realize that the world isn't a meritocracy, and luck and sociality play an important role. Maybe someone who has provided me an opportunity is reading this and is realizing they made a big mistake, and will change the way they pick people in the future. Or maybe (hopefully?) that person is thinking 'I like this guy's transparency, I like what he's doing here, maybe I didn't make a mistake'.</p>
      <p class="indent">And that brings me to the heart of it. I'm not special, and most of us aren't. I don't think I'm dumb (though the whole concept of comparative intelligence is a murky one for me), but I often feel lazy, and frequently, not nearly smart enough for the spaces I find myself in. But perhaps that's precisely why I'm talking to you. If my story, with all its perceived flaws, its strokes of luck, and its undercurrent of self-doubt, resonates with even one other person who feels like they're just winging it, then maybe that's reason enough. Maybe by sharing our unpolished, non-heroic narratives, we can collectively build a more honest picture of what it means to navigate academia, or life in general. Maybe it's less about having "sage advice" from a pedestal of achievement, and more about offering a hand-drawn map of a messy, ongoing journey. So, yes, I'm talking to you because I hope that in this shared vulnerability, we can all feel a little less alone in our imperfections and a little more entitled to our own, unique paths, however we stumble upon them.</p>

        Space for an Imposter
        <i class="fa fa-chevron-down fa-xs blog-icon"></i>
    </h2>
    <div id="post2" class="blog-post-content">
      <p class="indent">A piece of advice I've offered in the past to help others with imposter syndrome is this: instead of building yourself up, tear others down. Not in a mean 'they're all stupid and don't belong here' way, but in a 'they're all human' way. This is probably awful advice, but it sounds moderately profound, gets a few laughs, and seems to just fall out of my mouth every time the topic gets brought up. Although I don't actually follow this advice myself, it is, in a way, part of a two-step solution I seem to practice on a near daily basis with varying levels of efficacy. From my impression, most grad students feel imposter syndrome, and some post-docs and PIs have admitted it never truly goes away. Many of us feel like we don't belong here and we're not smart enough (granted, not ALL of us).</p>
      <p class="indent">But, if it walks like an academic and talks like an academic, does that sort of make it an academic? If I get kicked out of my PhD because my work is inadequate, then I probably would be an 'imposter'. Until then, however, I'm here. Maybe they made a mistake admitting me, maybe they didn't, but either way, let's see if this gamble pays off, right?</p>
      <p class="indent">I've met some truly remarkable people so far in academia. I've encountered many students I'm supposed to advise or supervise in some manner, and I'm consistently impressed and intimidated by how much they know. I've had mentors who seem to know everything and somehow accomplish so much in the same days that I accomplish so little. Of course I feel like an imposter; I am an imposter by comparison. I'm not as good as them. I haven't worked at an Ivy League school while completing groundbreaking experiments, raising kids, maintaining a family and house, being actively involved in outreach projects, and somehow also being a cool and friendly person on top of all that. My days often consist of a little bit of coding, then I go home, drink beer, spend time with my partner, and sometimes cook a little. BUT, maybe that's okay?</p>
      <p class="indent">Those students and mentors aren't actually superheroes; sometimes they make mistakes (like maybe hiring me). Sometimes I mention a paper they haven't heard of (so even though it feels like they know everything, that's obviously not possible). Sometimes I disagree on an experimental design. Sometimes I'm useful. Sometimes I provide insight. Sometimes I'm not a waste of money or time. Sometimes I accomplish impressive things. Sometimes I don't suck.</p>
      <p class="indent">I'm not saying I'm not an imposter, maybe I am, but I see four possibilities:</p>
      <p class="indent"><ol>
		<li>I am an imposter, I'll be found out, I'll be kicked out of academia, and then I won't have to struggle with 'imposter syndrome' anymore; I'll have my answer.</li>
		<li>I have imposter syndrome, but I'm actually awesome, just like everyone else here. I belong. I'll be fine.</li>
		<li>I have imposter syndrome, but I get kicked out of academia by mistake regardless, and that's a problem for another time.</li>
		<li>I am an imposter, but I'm such a good imposter that I trick everyone, get a PhD, and even stay in academia, fooling people every step of the way.</li>
	  </ol></p>
      <p class="indent">Honestly, scenario 4 is what I hope for the most. That way, I get to keep feeling the way I feel, nothing has to change, and I keep moving forward. If that is the case, then that's okay, right? If I pass the tests, if I get accepted into each stage of my path, does that mean 'I belong in academia' or not necessarily? My argument is for the latter. While the 'walks and talks like an academic' argument might hold some truth, I also think that diversity of thought is critical to science and philosophy. Maybe we should let a dummy be a professor every now and then. As long as they're able to fake it well enough, if the students are passing the classes, if their lab students are accomplishing tasks, maybe let them sneak on by.</p>
      <p class="indent">I don't need to list the evidence that diversity improves science; I'm likely preaching to the choir on that topic, and I'm no expert. But typically, when I think of diversity in science, the focus is on people who belong here but don't get the chance to show it. Who can argue with that? Not only should we ethically and morally try to recruit everyone who is smart, talented, and hard-working, but those diverse individuals improve the science as well. But is there room for an imposter? Someone who doesn't belong but snuck in? I don't want to argue that smart, hard-working people should be replaced by lazy dummies, but maybe that lazy dummy can offer something too. Give that lazy dummy a job as a professor, and maybe fewer people will experience imposter syndrome. Or maybe, that lazy dummy can get lucky by trying to fake it until they make it, and stumble upon tremendous success. Or perhaps, if there were more transparency, we would simply see that success looks like many different things.</p>
      <p class="indent">I often feel like someone who doesn't belong. Sometimes I don't feel that way. Sometimes, when I solve a problem in the lab, or I finish writing a script, or I just generally feel good about myself, when those things happen I can feel like the smartest person on the planet. In those moments, the dumbest thing about me seems to be the very idea that I don't belong. So maybe when I'm feeling down, I need to remind myself that I belong by humanizing everyone I feel I don't measure up to. Maybe sometimes I can feel better by convincing myself that it's okay to be an imposter. But what helps the most is realizing that there is no single definition of "belonging" in academia. I can't thank enough the wonderful scientists who have shared their experiences with me, either personally or by broadcasting them to the world, who have shown me that there is no single right path in science, no one way that success looks. There are just people invested in science. And I can feel like that. There is nothing I love more than the learning, experimenting, and troubleshooting that comes with science. I am SO incredibly lucky to have spent time in comfortable poverty, because I know what I want to do regardless of income. I'm going to do science, maybe as an imposter, but I'll either be a scientist or the best imposter I can be.</p>

		<div class="w3-container">
			<h5 class="w3-opacity">I am a non-traditional student with an absolute dedication to learning more about the brain. School has always been where I want to be, and learning has been what I want to do. My parents’ only career hope for me was that I finished high school, but every year I become more singularly focused on my path to a career in research. I have experienced many careers – I’ve worked either full or part-time since 17 – but none have provided me the same satisfaction I get from pursuing my academic interests. 
			<br>My goal is to earn a Ph.D., become a professor, and to run a lab of my own, but my current career objectives are to gain the skills and knowledge needed to design and execute my own experiments. When I started college at 18, I knew the topic that interested me the most was people and behavior, so I decided to study psychology. Unfortunately, a few months into my Freshman year, my father suffered a debilitating stroke. Shortly thereafter, my wife was diagnosed with Multiple Sclerosis and my grandmother died of Alzheimer’s Disease. Throughout this difficult time in my life, I realized that my interests lied more in understanding the physical mechanisms of behavior, than in the generalized teleological concepts that psychology provided.
			<br>
			<br>While working full-time, I also attended Dallas County Community College and earned an A.S. degree before transferring to UTD. I joined the Neuroscience Student Association (NSA) as soon as I arrived at UTD. NSA helped me to both find mentors and the confidence to become a mentor myself. After a year of participating in the organization as a member I was elected Vice-President. As VP, NSA became my pride and joy: I invigorated our online presence, obtained volunteer opportunities for members to attend two local neuroscience conferences, and hosted events with medical students, grad students, and faculty to show our members the importance and utility of understanding research. After a year serving as VP, I became the President and I adapted our group for entirely virtual engagement and started a book club with free copies of neuroscience books provided by authors.
			<br>
			<br>Since research is so important to me, I also gained experience as an undergraduate research assistant starting with The Texas Biomedical Device Center (TxBDC). Much of my job there consisted of managing the habituation, training, and care of the research animals, and I also spent any extra time in the lab observing and learning as much as I could. Outside of animal handling, I exceled at troubleshooting, I ventured into perfusions and micro-construction, and I observed surgeries and both motor and auditory mapping. I eventually left TxBDC with the opportunity to learn different skills in the Pain Lab under a work-study. In the Pain Lab I surgically removed trigeminal nerves from mice and cultured them for electrophysiology.
			<br>
			<br>I have also obtained professional experience by interning for Ted’s Brain Science (Ted’s), an applied neuroscience company. While it started as simply managing wholesale accounts, I continued proving myself useful by attending and participating in several company meetings and performing data analysis and visualization.  While working at Ted’s one of the most beneficial experiences I had was when I helped write, compile, and submit a grant application.
			<br>
			<br>To expand my skills, I’d like to add to my experience in animal and cellular research with brain imaging, computational modeling, and human behavioral experiments. This conveniently coincides with my increased interest in researching cognitive systems. What interests me most are epistemic metacognition and intrinsic motivation. I’d like to work on answering questions like: how do we know what we know, and how is behavior affected by motivations outside more direct dopaminergic reward pathways?
